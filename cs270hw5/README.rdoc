   Description: Creating and setting up the apps and controllers 

At this point, we should have the basics of our model functionality and can start
using them in the controllers and views.  Thus, in this assignment, we will start 
to setup our app controllers and views.

<b>Step 1 - Update <tt>config/routes.rb</tt></b>

We need a way to handle each specific incoming HTTP request.  Recall from our
discussion on MVC, each request comes into and is handled by a controller.  Thus,
we need to map each request to a specific controller/action.

Rails accomplishes this mapping in the <tt>config/routes.rb</tt> file.  In that 
file we can assign the root URL as well as map individual requests to controller/action
pairs.

A route in Rails consists of three parts: 

* an HTTP request method
* a URL
* a controller/action pair

The format for defining a route is indicated in the comment section of the routes
file.

We want to create routes to handle the following tasks (for each model):

* create a new object (i.e., create an event)
* view all objects (i.e., view all events)
* view a single object (i.e., view a single event)
* edit an object (i.e., edit a single event)
* delete an object (i.e., delete a single event)

We can lay out our routes as a conceptual table, like this:

<tt>REQUEST METHOD     URL          CONTROLLER/ACTION</tt>

<tt>--------------     ---          -----------------</tt>

<tt>GET                '/events'    events#show_all_events</tt>

<tt>GET                '/event/:id' events#show_event</tt>

<tt>POST               '/event/new' events#create_events</tt>

<tt>                   ...</tt>

For three models (events, locations, and users), we have 5 tasks, so we need to
define 15 routes in our routes file.define

<b>Step 2 - Create controllers</b>

In order for our routes to work, we need to create controllers for each model.
We do so by creating a file in the <tt>app/controllers</tt> directory for each controller.
For example. to create the events controller, you would create a file named <tt>events_controller.rb</tt>

Take note of the lower-case/underscore/plural conventions!

What is a controller?  Like everything in Rails, it's an object, and that means 
it's defined as a class.  So, we need to define a controller class inside of each controller
file.

For example, for the events controller, we would define:

<tt>class EventsController < ApplicationController</tt>

<tt>end</tt>

Again, pay attention to the plural/camel-case conventions used by Rails!

Then, after defining each controller, we need to populate the controllers with the
appropriate methods, called 'actions' in Rails.

We need a method for each controller action referenced in the routes file.  For
example, for the route mapped to 'events#show_all_events', we need to define a method
in the events controller as follows:

<tt>def show_all_events</tt>

<tt>end</tt>

In the next phase, we'll go back and write code to make the controllers actually do
some processing, but for now just define the routes and controllers.
